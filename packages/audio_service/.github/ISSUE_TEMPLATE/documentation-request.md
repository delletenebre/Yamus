        Note: Issues that don't follow these instructions will be closed,
        therefore please read them carefully.

        1. This form is not intended for asking questions or asking for
           support. For that, you are advised to ask your question on
           StackOverflow or Gitter. Instead, this form is intended for people
           who wish to help improve this plugin's documentation in a concrete
           way.

        2. To that end, it is required that you link to the specific
           page/section, and quote the words that are unclear (unless you are
           proposing an entirely new section), and describe how you would like
           it to be improved.

        THANK YOU :-D
