<!--

        Note: Issues that don't follow these instructions will be closed,
        therefore please read them carefully.

        1. A prerequisite before requesting a feature is that you familiarise
           yourself with the existing features by reading the API
           documentation.

        2. If it is unclear from the documentation whether an existing feature
           is the one you want, this is a shortcoming of the documentation. In
           this case, please submit a documentation request instead.

        3. Do not use this form for asking questions. My goal is to provide
           good documentation that answers your questions, and if the
           documentation isn't doing its job, please submit a documentation
           request to help me to improve it. Remember that the purpose of this
           GitHub issues page is for plugin development and not for support
           (community support is available via StackOverflow and Gitter).

        4. You must complete at least the first 3 sections below. Leave the
           section headings intact, and insert your answers below each heading.

        THANK YOU :-D
